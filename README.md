# memory-share
This is a web-based platform designed to help hosts of events (example; couples etc.) create private or public digital spaces to collect and preserve memories from special events (like weddings or parties). Using a QR-code-based upload system, guests at the event can quickly contribute photos and videos without needing to sign up or log in.
